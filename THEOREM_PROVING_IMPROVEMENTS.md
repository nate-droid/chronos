# Theorem Proving Improvements for Chronos C∀O

This document summarizes the major improvements made to the Chronos C∀O REPL to make it more intuitive and powerful for theorem proving and mathematical reasoning.

## Overview

The C∀O language already had strong mathematical foundations with ordinal analysis, type inference, and axiom support. However, the REPL interface needed enhancements to make theorem proving more accessible and intuitive. This document outlines the improvements that transform C∀O into a practical theorem proving environment.

## What We've Built

### 1. Missing Core Words Implementation

**Problem**: The core library documented `help` and `words` commands that weren't actually implemented in the VM.

**Solution**: Added proper implementations for these essential words:

- `help` - Shows comprehensive documentation of all core library functions with type signatures
- `words` - Lists all available words (both core and user-defined) in a formatted display

**Impact**: Users can now discover functionality and get help directly within the language, making C∀O self-documenting.

### 2. Enhanced REPL Commands for Theorem Proving

**Problem**: No structured way to manage mathematical theories, track proof progress, or organize axioms and theorems.

**Solution**: Added a comprehensive set of theorem proving commands:

- `.axioms` - List all declared axioms in the system
- `.theorems` - List all proven theorems (non-axiom word definitions)
- `.assume <proposition>` - Add assumptions to the current proof context
- `.goal <proposition>` - Set the current proof goal
- `.prove` - Show the current proof state (stack, assumptions, goals)
- `.qed` - Mark the current proof as complete

**Impact**: Provides a structured workflow for mathematical reasoning and proof construction.

### 3. Improved Axiom and Theorem Tracking

**Problem**: No easy way to distinguish between axioms and proven theorems, or to see the mathematical structure of the current system.

**Solution**: Enhanced the REPL to automatically categorize and display:

- **Axioms**: Words declared with the `axiom` keyword (marked with `is_axiom: true`)
- **Theorems**: Words with actual implementations (proofs) in their body
- **Type signatures**: Clear display of mathematical types for all declarations

**Impact**: Users can easily see the logical structure of their mathematical theories and track what has been proven vs. what is assumed.

### 4. Proof Workflow Integration

**Problem**: No clear methodology for constructing proofs in the stack-based environment.

**Solution**: Created a natural proof workflow that leverages C∀O's stack-based nature:

1. **State the goal**: Use `.goal` to declare what you want to prove
2. **Add assumptions**: Use `.assume` to add necessary premises
3. **Construct the proof**: Use regular C∀O operations to manipulate the stack
4. **Verify the result**: The stack contains your proof result
5. **Complete the proof**: Use `.qed` to mark the proof as finished

**Impact**: Provides a clear, repeatable methodology for mathematical reasoning in C∀O.

### 5. Enhanced Help and Documentation System

**Problem**: Difficult to discover available functionality or understand how to use the theorem proving features.

**Solution**: Comprehensive help system with multiple levels:

- `help` - Core library documentation with type signatures
- `.help` - REPL command documentation
- Integrated examples and usage patterns
- Self-documenting command structure

**Impact**: Makes the system accessible to new users and serves as a reference for advanced features.

## Practical Examples

### Basic Theorem Proving

```cao
C∀O> :: square ( Nat -> Nat ) ;
Type signature declared for 'square'

C∀O> : square dup * ;
Defined word 'square'

C∀O> .goal "Prove that square(4) = 16"
Proof goal: "Prove that square(4) = 16"

C∀O> 4 square
C∀O> 16 =
C∀O> .s
<1> true

C∀O> .qed
Proof completed!
```

### Mathematical Theory Building

```cao
C∀O> :: zero ( -> Nat ) ;
Type signature declared for 'zero'

C∀O> axiom zero
Declared axiom 'zero'

C∀O> :: successor ( Nat -> Nat ) ;
Type signature declared for 'successor'

C∀O> axiom successor
Declared axiom 'successor'

C∀O> :: one ( -> Nat ) ;
Type signature declared for 'one'

C∀O> : one zero successor ;
Defined word 'one'

C∀O> .axioms
Available Axioms:
================
  zero :: TypeSignature { inputs: [], outputs: [Nat] }
  successor :: TypeSignature { inputs: [Nat], outputs: [Nat] }
  ... (other core axioms)

C∀O> .theorems
Proven Theorems:
===============
  one :: TypeSignature { inputs: [], outputs: [Nat] }
```

### Interactive Proof Construction

```cao
C∀O> .assume "All natural numbers are well-ordered"
Added assumption: "All natural numbers are well-ordered"

C∀O> .goal "5 has a unique predecessor"
Proof goal: "5 has a unique predecessor"

C∀O> .prove
Current Proof State:
===================
Stack: []
Assumptions: ["All natural numbers are well-ordered"]
Goal: "5 has a unique predecessor"
```

## Architecture Overview

### New VM Builtin Words

The VM now includes these additional builtin implementations:

- `builtin_help()` - Comprehensive core library documentation
- `builtin_words()` - Formatted listing of all available words

### Enhanced REPL Command Handler

The REPL command processor now handles:

- Theorem proving workflow commands (`.axioms`, `.theorems`, etc.)
- Proof state management (`.assume`, `.goal`, `.prove`, `.qed`)
- Integration with existing debugging and development commands

### Axiom/Theorem Classification

The system automatically distinguishes between:

- **Axioms**: Words with `is_axiom: true` and empty body
- **Theorems**: Words with `is_axiom: false` and non-empty body (actual proofs)
- **Pending**: Type signatures without implementations

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements

1. **Proof Object Storage**: Store actual proof objects that can be verified and replayed
2. **Assumption Stack**: Proper management of assumptions with scoping
3. **Goal Decomposition**: Break complex goals into subgoals
4. **Automated Tactics**: Simple proof automation for common patterns
5. **Theory Modules**: Namespace system for organizing related theorems

### Axiom System Framework

The foundation is laid for introducing full axiom systems entirely within the C∀O language:

- **Axiom System Types**: Data structures for organizing axioms and rules
- **Theory Morphisms**: Translations between different mathematical theories
- **Consistency Checking**: Verify that axiom sets don't lead to contradictions
- **Independence Proofs**: Show that axioms cannot be derived from others

## Integration with Existing Features

### Type Inference

The theorem proving improvements integrate seamlessly with C∀O's existing type inference:

- `.infer <word>` shows inferred types for theorems
- Type signatures guide proof construction
- Polymorphic types support general mathematical reasoning

### Ordinal Analysis

The ordinal system supports complexity analysis of proofs:

- Each proof step has an associated ordinal cost
- Termination proofs ensure that all reasoning terminates
- Complexity bounds help optimize proof strategies

### Session Management

Theorem proving work integrates with session persistence:

- `.save <session>` preserves axioms, theorems, and proof state
- `.load <session>` restores mathematical contexts

## Conclusion

These improvements transform Chronos C∀O from a research language into a practical theorem proving environment. The enhanced REPL provides intuitive commands for mathematical reasoning while preserving the language's rigorous mathematical foundations. The stack-based proof construction feels natural and the clear separation of axioms from theorems helps users understand the logical structure of their mathematical theories.

The foundation is now in place for even more advanced features, including full axiom system frameworks that can be defined entirely within the C∀O language itself, making it a powerful platform for mathematical research and formal verification.

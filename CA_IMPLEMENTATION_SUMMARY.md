# Cellular Automata System Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented a graphical cellular automata system within the Chronos REPL that allows exploration of elementary cellular automata (and provides a foundation for more complex systems like Codd's cellular automata) without cluttering the main runtime.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. **Clean Architecture**
- **Isolated in REPL**: CA functionality lives entirely in the REPL layer (`src/repl.rs`)
- **No Runtime Pollution**: Core Chronos language and VM remain untouched
- **Optional Feature**: Can be easily removed without affecting core functionality

### 2. **Elementary Cellular Automata Engine**
- **Wolfram Rules**: Support for all 256 elementary CA rules (0-255)
- **Pattern Support**: Custom initial patterns using multiple notation formats
- **Evolution Engine**: Efficient step-by-step CA evolution
- **History Tracking**: Maintains complete evolution history

### 3. **Multiple Interaction Modes**

# Chronos: An Evolving Axiomatic Programming Language

**C∀O (Kao)** - *Categorical ∀xiomatic Ordinal*

## Vision

Chronos is a revolutionary computing ecosystem where the programming language itself evolves through collaborative verification. It enables the growth of complex, provably correct software systems from a minimal set of core mathematical truths, combining Category Theory, Ordinal Analysis, and concatenative programming paradigms.

## Core Principles

- **Categorical Foundation**: Types are objects, functions are morphisms
- **Ordinal Verification**: Guaranteed termination and consistency through proof theory
- **Concatenative Core**: Stack-based, postfix syntax promoting interactive development
- **Axiomatic Extensibility**: User-defined types and axioms with proof verification

## The C∀O Language Specification

### Execution Model

C∀O is a concatenative (postfix) language operating on a data stack. Words are space-delimited and executed left-to-right.

```
3 4 +    ( pushes 3, then 4, then executes +, resulting in 7 )
```

### Syntax Elements

#### Comments
```
( This is a comment )
( Comments are enclosed in parentheses )
```

#### Word Definition
```
: square ( n -> n*n ) dup * ;
```

#### Type Signatures
Every user-defined word requires an explicit type signature:
```
:: square ( Nat -> Nat ) ;
: square dup * ;
```

#### Type Definition
New types are defined using the `type` keyword:
```
:: Point ( Nat Nat -> Point ) ;
type Point { x::Nat, y::Nat }
```

#### Axiom Definition
Unproven assertions accepted as true:
```
:: oracle ( -> Nat ) ;
axiom oracle
```

### Core Types

| Type | Description | Examples |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `Unit` | Terminal object | `()` |
| `Bool` | Boolean values | `true`, `false` |
| `Nat` | Natural numbers | `0`, `1`, `2`, ... |
| `Ordinal` | Proof-theoretic ordinals | Used internally by system |
| `Quote` | Code blocks as data | `[ dup * ]` |

### Core Words

#### Stack Manipulation
- `dup` - Duplicate top stack element
- `drop` - Remove top stack element  
- `swap` - Exchange top two elements
- `over` - Copy second element to top
- `rot` - Rotate three elements

#### Control Flow
- `if` - Conditional execution (consumes Bool and two Quotes)

#### Arithmetic
- `+`, `-`, `*` - Basic arithmetic for Nat

#### System Words
- `--ordinal` - Calculate ordinal cost of definition
- `submit-to-hypervisor` - Submit definition for global verification

### Example Programs

#### Basic Arithmetic
```
: double ( n -> 2n ) 2 * ;
:: double ( Nat -> Nat ) ;

5 double    ( Result: 10 )
```

#### Conditional Logic
```
: abs ( n -> |n| ) 
  dup 0 < [ 0 swap - ] [ ] if ;
:: abs ( Int -> Nat ) ;
```

#### Working with Types
```
:: Point ( Nat Nat -> Point ) ;
type Point { x::Nat, y::Nat }

: distance-squared ( p1 p2 -> dist² )
  ( Extract coordinates and calculate (x2-x1)² + (y2-y1)² )
  ...implementation... ;
:: distance-squared ( Point Point -> Nat ) ;
```

## System Architecture

### The Ordinal Hypervisor (`chronosd`)

The central authority ensuring global consistency:

- **Master Theory Database**: Canonical store of verified definitions
- **Validation Engine**: Ordinal Analysis proof checker
- **Communication API**: gRPC interface for cells

#### Key API Endpoints
```
rpc RegisterCell(RegisterRequest) returns (RegisterResponse);
rpc GetMasterTheory(TheoryRequest) returns (stream TheoryUpdate);
rpc SubmitDefinition(DefinitionPackage) returns (ValidationResult);
```

### Evolutionary Cells (`kao-shell`)

Interactive development environments:

- **C∀O Runtime**: Parser, stack machine, core library
- **Local Theory State**: Cached master theory + local definitions  
- **Hypervisor Client**: gRPC communication layer

### Workflow Example

1. **Bootstrap**: Cell registers with hypervisor, downloads master theory
2. **Local Development**: User defines new functions locally
   ```
   : fibonacci ( n -> fib(n) ) 
     dup 2 < [ ] [ dup 1 - fibonacci swap 2 - fibonacci + ] if ;
   :: fibonacci ( Nat -> Nat ) ;
   ```
3. **Verification**: Local ordinal analysis ensures termination
4. **Submission**: 
   ```
   [ :: fibonacci ( Nat -> Nat ) ; 
     : fibonacci dup 2 < [ ] [ dup 1 - fibonacci swap 2 - fibonacci + ] if ; 
   ] submit-to-hypervisor
   ```
5. **Global Integration**: Hypervisor validates and broadcasts to all cells

## Language Philosophy

### Mathematical Foundations

C∀O is built on solid mathematical principles:

- **Category Theory**: Provides the structural foundation for types and functions
- **Ordinal Analysis**: Ensures all programs terminate and the system remains consistent
- **Constructive Logic**: Every proof corresponds to a computable function

### Evolutionary Properties

- **Collaborative Growth**: The language evolves through community contributions
- **Verified Extensions**: All additions must pass rigorous proof requirements
- **Backward Compatibility**: New definitions cannot break existing theory

### Interactive Development

The concatenative nature promotes:

- **Immediate Feedback**: Every word can be tested interactively
- **Compositional Thinking**: Complex programs built from simple, verified components
- **Bottom-up Design**: Start with primitives, build complexity gradually

while shell.autonomous_step()? {
    // Shell is making progress...
}
```

### Goal Management
```rust
// Add various types of goals
shell.add_goal(quick::fibonacci(10))?;
shell.add_goal(quick::prove("‚àÄn: n + 0 = n"))?;
shell.add_goal(quick::explore("Prime Numbers"))?;
```

### Multi-Shell Coordination
```rust
// Coordinate multiple shells
manager.set_strategy(CoordinationStrategy::Collaborative {
    knowledge_sharing: true,
    load_balancing: true,
});
manager.coordination_step()?;
```

### State Persistence
```rust
// Save and restore shell state
shell.save_shell_state("session.json")?;
shell.load_shell_state("session.json")?;
```
